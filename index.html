            <h1>Like Tears in Rain</h1>
            <h2>Where am I going? How long have I got?</h2>
            <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I
                watched
                C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time... like
                tears in rain... Time to die.</p>
            <p>I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had
                before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers...</p>
